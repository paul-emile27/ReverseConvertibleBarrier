#ReverseConvertibleBarrierPricer
Pricing of a reverse convertible barrier  - Project 2 of Practice of Structured Products - w/ Ismael Bendib

The goal of this project is to price a RBC with monte carlo simulations and compute its greeks. 

We will try one approach with Black-Scholes model then one approach with a more sophisticated model : Heston model. 

- RBC_BlackScholes.py : computation of the MC estimator for BS model
- RBC_Heston.py :  computation of the MC estimator for Heston model
- Greeks_BlackScholes : computation of the Greeks  for BS model
- Greeks_Heston : computation of the Greeks  for Heston model
